This book, "Apki Bar Modi Sarkar," reads like a dry, uninspired textbook on Indian politics, devoid of any engaging narrative or captivating storytelling. The author seems more concerned with presenting a factual account of Modi's rise and reign than with crafting a compelling and impactful narrative. 

**Here's a breakdown of the problems:**

* **"Tell, don't show":** The entire book is dominated by exposition. Instead of immersing the reader in the events, the author merely tells them what happened, leaving no room for the reader to experience the story firsthand. 
* **Lack of dialogue:**  The absence of dialogue creates a sterile and detached atmosphere.  Dialogue breathes life into a narrative, allowing the reader to hear the voices of the characters and understand their perspectives.
* **Overuse of generic language:** The author relies heavily on bland, descriptive language, lacking any sense of nuance or emotional weight.  There's a complete absence of evocative language, metaphors, or similes that could bring the events to life. 
* **Passive voice:** The author relies excessively on passive voice, making the writing feel distant and impersonal.  Active voice breathes energy into a narrative, making it more engaging and dynamic.
* **Lack of character development:**  The book treats Modi as a political figure, a symbol, but fails to explore him as a human being with complexities, flaws, and motivations. This lack of depth makes it difficult for the reader to connect with the subject. 
* **Missing human impact:**  The author focuses heavily on policy details and events, neglecting the human impact of these decisions.  The book feels emotionally distant, lacking the personal stories and perspectives that would make it resonate with readers.

**Here's what the author needs to do:**

* **Show, don't tell:**  Replace exposition with vivid scenes and descriptions.  Instead of saying "Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan," show a scene of Modi interacting with a village woman, demonstrating the practicalities of the program.
* **Introduce dialogue:**  Create scenes with conversations between characters. Show the reactions of people affected by Modi's policies through their own words.
* **Use active voice:**  Make the writing more dynamic and engaging by using active voice.  Instead of "The demonetization decision was met with widespread public reaction," write "The demonetization decision sparked widespread public outcry."
* **Develop characters:**  Explore the human side of Modi, his motivations, and his internal struggles.  Show him interacting with his advisors, his family, or those who oppose him. 
* **Focus on the human impact:** Include stories of people whose lives are affected by Modi's policies.  This could be a farmer struggling with debt, a student activist facing repression, or a family displaced by the 2002 riots.
* **Embrace nuance:**  Don't shy away from presenting both sides of the story.  Explore the complexity of Modi's legacy, acknowledging his achievements alongside his failures and controversies.

**The author needs to shift from a dry, factual account to a narrative that captures the reader's imagination, emotions, and intellect. This requires a significant rewrite, focusing on showing, not telling, and weaving a compelling narrative that explores the human dimensions of the story.**
